# Mindfulness at the Computer

This application reminds you to take breaks from the computer, helps you
remember to stay in touch with and be mindful of your breathing and body
while sitting at the computer, and helps you concentrate on breathing
in and out when you need a breathing pause.

**The [application website](https://sunyatazero.github.io/mindfulness-at-the-computer/)
has more information** (including screenshots and downloads).

The application is written in Python and uses Qt/PyQt for the front-end.
